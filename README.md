# dbarepo

ofcourse the only real dba's are Oracle dba's so no mickey sql info here or big blue db info.

Currently i am in the process making an own designed database structure.
It resembles much of oracle but more in the fire up and forget principle. Which oracle calls 'managed' services.

It will be:
- scalable, much like RAC.
- secure by using transparant encryption techniques.
- 247 uptime even when patching or migrating.
- open source
- cloud version for the devops people
- ansi sql compatible
- triggers
- views
- ultra text search
- no application in the database principle. The application is pluggable instead of the database.
- integration with famous dashboard, monitoring, middleware software. List will follow...
- no bias towards some programming language. Only ansi sql.
